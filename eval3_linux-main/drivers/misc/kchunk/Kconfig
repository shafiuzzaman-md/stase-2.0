config KCHUNK
    bool "Kernel handle-based heap allocator"
    default y
    help
      Enables the kernel chunk allocator subsystem, which provides a handle-based
      fixed-size memory chunk allocator for kernel-internal use. This allocator
      supports multiple size classes, dynamic region growth, and concurrency-safe
      access via spinlocks.

      This option is intended for use by other kernel components that require
      fast and predictable memory chunk allocation behavior.

      If unsure, say Y.
